# Setup
The following software is required

* Ruby 1.8.6 or 1.8.7
* RubyGems
* Git (I recommend gitbash on Windows)
* Rhodes
  Install latest Rhodes gem:
  http://dev.rhomobile.com/brian/rhodes-1.4.0.gem
  Download that and do 'gem install rhodes-1.4.0.gem'  (on the mac you want to: sudo gem install ...)
* Rhosync
  You won't need the Rhodes source, but I recommend getting rhosync from source:
git clone git://github.com/rhomobile/rhosync.git

* On Mac, they will need XCode and should install the latest iPhone SDK
* Everyone should install the Android SDK
* Windows folks probably want to install the Blackberry SDK
